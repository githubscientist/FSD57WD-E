# React- Day -1: ES5 vs ES6

**Contents:**

[x] ES5 vs Es6

ES5: EcmaScript 5 is the old version of javascript. It was released in 2009. It is supported by all browsers.

ES6:

- EcmaScript 6 is the new version of javascript.
- It was released in 2015.
- It is not supported by all browsers.
- It is also known as ES2015.
- This version is very popular because of introducing new features like arrow functions, classes, template strings, let, const, and many more.

[x] Scoping - var vs let vs const  
[x] arrow functions

- Arrow functions are a new way of writing function expressions in JavaScript.
- They are more concise than traditional function expressions allowing us to write one-liners without the need for the return keyword.

[x] template literals

- Template literals are string literals allowing embedded expressions.
- You can use multi-line strings and string interpolation features with them.

[x] spread & rest prarameter

spread operator:

- ... is a spread operator.
- It allows an iterable to expand in places where 0+ arguments are expected.

rest parameter:

- ... is a rest parameter.
- It allows us to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array.

[x] array & object destructure

- Destructuring is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables.

[x] property shorthand

- Property shorthand is a feature of ES6 that allows you to create object literals without repeating yourself.

[] Class in Javascript
[] use of this keyword(lexical scoping)
[] module import & export
