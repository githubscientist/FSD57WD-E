- EcmaScript 6 is the new version of javascript.
- It was released in 2015.
- It is not supported by all browsers.
- It is also known as ES2015.
- This version is very popular because of introducing new features like arrow functions, classes, template strings, let, const, and many more.

[x] Scoping - var vs let vs const  
[x] arrow functions

- Arrow functions are a new way of writing function expressions in JavaScript.
- They are more concise than traditional function expressions allowing us to write one-liners without the need for the return keyword.

[x] template literals

- Template literals are string literals allowing embedded expressions.
- You can use multi-line strings and string interpolation features with them.
